    <h3>About</h3>

    <p><strong>Company Name:</strong> Aaka’s Innovation</p>

    <p>
        Aaka’s Innovation is a fictional manufacturing company focused on developing next-generation
        consumer products using artificial intelligence (AI) and smart manufacturing technologies.
        The company aims to transform traditional household products into intelligent, data-driven
        solutions that improve user comfort, health, and sustainability.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of Aaka’s Innovation’s core products is <strong>Mattress 2.0</strong>, an AI-enabled mattress
        designed to optimize sleep quality through intelligent design, material selection, and advanced
        manufacturing processes.

    <h3>Seeker</h3>

    <p>
        The Open Innovation Challenge is launched by the <strong>Innovation and Advanced Manufacturing Team</strong>
        at Aaka’s Innovation.
    </p>

    <p>
        The team is responsible for integrating AI, simulation tools, and smart manufacturing systems into
        product development.
    </p>

    <p>
        Due to the complexity of combining sleep science, AI modeling, materials engineering, and scalable
        manufacturing, Aaka’s Innovation is seeking external ideas, technologies, and concepts from innovators
        worldwide through an open innovation approach.

<!-- ================= THEORY ================= -->
<section id="theory" class="section light">
    <h3>Theory: What Is Open Innovation by Crowdsourcing</h3>

    <p>
        Open innovation is an innovation approach where companies go beyond their internal knowledge and
        actively involve external actors, such as startups, researchers, students, suppliers, and users,
        to develop new solutions.
    </p>

    <p>
        Crowdsourcing is a key mechanism of open innovation. It allows a company to open a specific problem
        to a broad audience, collect diverse ideas, and identify innovative solutions that may not emerge
        internally.
    </p>

    <p>
        By using open innovation through crowdsourcing, companies can:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Access multidisciplinary expertise</li>
        <li>Reduce development time and cost</li>
        <li>Encourage creative and unconventional solutions</li>
        <li>Accelerate innovation in complex systems</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Aaka’s Innovation adopts this approach to address the challenges of designing and manufacturing an
        intelligent mattress that meets technical, economic, and sustainability goals.

<section id="challenge" class="section grey">
    <h3>The Challenge</h3>

    <h4>Background</h4>
    <p>
        Traditional mattresses are designed using fixed structures and limited personalization. However,
        sleep quality is influenced by many factors such as body posture, weight distribution, materials,
        and individual comfort preferences.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mattress 2.0 aims to use AI-based simulation and smart manufacturing to improve comfort, adaptability,
        and sustainability.
    </p>

    <p>
        The main challenge is to design a mattress system that can:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Adapt to different users</li>
        <li>Be manufactured efficiently at scale</li>
        <li>Remain affordable and sustainable</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Aaka’s Innovation recognizes that solving this challenge requires knowledge from multiple domains
        and therefore opens this problem to external contributors.
    </p>

    <h4>Technical Requirements</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>AI or simulation models for predicting sleep comfort and pressure distribution</li>
        <li>Smart material combinations or modular mattress layers</li>
        <li>Data-driven customization methods for different users</li>
        <li>Manufacturing concepts that support flexible or mass-customized production</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Solutions should be technically feasible and compatible with modern manufacturing environments.
    </p>

    <h4>Economical Requirements</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Be cost-effective for large-scale manufacturing</li>
        <li>Avoid overly complex or expensive components</li>
        <li>Consider production, logistics, and maintenance costs</li>
        <li>Demonstrate potential for commercial viability</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Affordability and scalability are essential for market adoption.
    </p>

    <h4>SDGs Impact</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SDG 3 – Good Health and Well-Being:</strong> Improving sleep quality and physical comfort</li>
        <li><strong>SDG 9 – Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure:</strong> Promoting smart manufacturing and digital innovation</li>
        <li><strong>SDG 12 – Responsible Consumption and Production:</strong> Encouraging efficient material use and reduced waste</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        Participants are encouraged to highlight the sustainability impact of their solutions.
    </p>

    <h4>Award</h4>
    <ul>
