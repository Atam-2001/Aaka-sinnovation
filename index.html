    <h3>Theory: Open Innovation by Crowdsourcing</h3>
    <p>
        Open innovation is an approach where companies go beyond internal knowledge and actively involve
        external actors such as startups, researchers, students, suppliers, and users.
    </p>
    <p>
        Crowdsourcing allows a company to open a problem to a broad audience, collect diverse ideas,
        and identify innovative solutions that may not emerge internally.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Access multidisciplinary expertise</li>
        <li>Reduce development time and cost</li>
        <li>Encourage creative and unconventional solutions</li>
        <li>Accelerate innovation in complex systems</li>
    </ul>
